# Library - Gutreads

### Purpose
This is my approach to the Library project assigned by The Odin Project.

### Features
- Input a book of choice with details like 'Title', 'Author', 'Pages', and 'Read/Not Read'
- Keeps track of all your books
- Change read status
- Delete book from chart
- Counter for total books!

### Reflection
This project helped me hone my abilites with working with arrays and object constructors.  While the localstorage API isn't used for this project, it still helped me get my feet wet with JS objects.
